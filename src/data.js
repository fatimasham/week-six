        description: "Touché is the term used when someone admits that another person made a good point, and there couldn’t be a more perfect name to describe this beautiful café. You won’t be disappointed while you are immersed in this minimalist cafe with modern Balinese finishing. The café has more Earth tones and wicker furniture to give you the bohemian feel of Bali. However, the sculptures add a modern touch making this a great space to get inspired. Touché is located in the Canggu area of Bali.",

        description: "Doppio Café Pink welcomes guests with its open air and unique pink walls. You can choose where to sit, but keep in mind that there’s so much to see in this small café. There’s a pink-walled alley, pink bicycle and two different spaces to choose from. You can’t go wrong with either side, but the best view is the space directly behind the pink bike. There, people can watch during a busy Bali morning. If you are interested in the best view in the cafe, get there as early as possible because these seats fill up fast.",

        description: "While many of the most beautiful cafes in Bali play on pink and floral energy or a bohemian vibe, Lazy Cats Cafe offers a different kind of beauty. It still offers bohemian flair, but it adds in a mix of fashionable and vintage décor. Walking inside ignites all of your senses because it’s an eccentric atmosphere that serves as a café, bar and gallery in Ubud.",

Located in Eastern Bali, this café is the only place to get a close view of the majestic Agung Mountain and rice fields. Its beauty is unmatched, and the location is a hidden gem because not many people frequent Eastern Bali. This location is about two hours east of the popular Seminyak area. It’s perfect for people who enjoy being in a less popular place.",
